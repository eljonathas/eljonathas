### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Computer Science Student at the Federal University of ParÃ¡ State, i can describe me like a total technology lover. Computational Intelligence enthusiastic, Software Development and Javascript Programmer, i see me as someone who is entirely dedicated to looking for different paths and experiences in this area, in addition to improving more and more my academic background on these concepts.

In my view, programming is an art, and solving human problems with computing has become essential for the development of society. In view of this, I seek to direct all my learning to this area, especially with a focus on the intellectual contribution to reach this goal.
